# AI vs Real Art: Deepfake Detection using State-of-the-Art AI Models

## Overview
This repository provides tools and methodologies for detecting AI-generated ("deepfake") artworks and distinguishing them from human-created art using cutting-edge artificial intelligence models. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the system offers robust detection capabilities, ensuring authenticity in the art world.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:** Tools to normalize and prepare images for analysis.
- **Deepfake Detection:** Model designed to analyze patterns indicative of AI generation.
- **Explainability:** Insights into why an artwork is flagged as AI-generated.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Flexible configurations for adapting to new types of deepfake art.
- **Visualization:** Tools to display detection results and model interpretability.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following software and libraries are installed:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-vs-real-art.git
   cd ai-vs-real-art
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained model weights (link to be provided in the repository) and place them in the `models/` directory.

## Usage
### Running the Detection
1. Prepare your dataset of artworks in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect_art.py --input data/sample_art --output results/
   ```
3. Review the detection results in the `results/` directory.

### Configuration
Modify the `config.yaml` file to:
- Set model parameters.
- Adjust preprocessing steps.
- Define detection thresholds.
